gives a high level view of the courses in which you're enrolled. Your instructor
will release new courses as you go through the program.

**Global Navigation** - static menu on the left side of the page and accessible
from any page on Canvas, the Global Navigation gives you direct access to your
courses and other information in Canvas.

**Sidebar** - found within each course, the Sidebar houses various features that
allow access to the course materials.
